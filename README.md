# bibel

Read the Word of God from your terminal

This is the Einheits√ºbersetzung from 1980 without annotations. An implementation to allow for annotations might be useful in the future.

Code largely based off of [https://github.com/bontibon/kjv.git](https://github.com/bontibon/kjv.git). Luke Smith ([lukesmith.xyz](https://lukesmith.xyz/)) brought my attention to this software via a video of his.
